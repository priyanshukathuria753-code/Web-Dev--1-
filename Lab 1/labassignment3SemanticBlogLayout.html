                <h2>Anime </h2>
                <p>Anime, short for Japanese animation, is a globally popular art form and media style originating in Japan, distinguished by its unique visual aesthetic, diverse genres, and complex storytelling. Starting with early films in the 1910s and gaining momentum through the work of pioneers like Osamu Tezuka in the 1960s, anime has evolved into a major cultural force, now accessible on major streaming platforms and influencing global pop culture through its adaptations into various media like manga, video games, and merchandise.</p>

                <h2>Movie Review </h2>
                <p>When Kalyani Priyadarshan says that she hasn’t yet fathomed the enormity of Lokah Chapter 1: Chandra’s success, she isn’t joking. The superhero movie has amassed a sum somewhere between ₹250 crore and ₹260 crore, making it the highest-grossing Malayalam movie of all time. What’s equally amusing is that this feat was achieved in a female-led action comedy that borrows heavily from Kerala’s centuries’ old folklore. It ranks as the sixth-highest grossing Indian movie of the year and is expected to end its run as the second-highest grossing woman-led Indian movie of all time, behind 2023’s The Kerala Story.

But as The Hollywood Reporter India meets Priyadarshan for a photoshoot and an interview right after, two weeks after the film’s release, she appears to not have had the time to recalibrate herself to these dizzying new heights of stardom. “I’m not sure if it’s my imposter syndrome talking but it just hasn’t sunk in… it all feels surreal,” she says, when asked about how life-changing these days have been.</p>
