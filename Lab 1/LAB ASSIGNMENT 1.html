    <h2>My Interests</h2>

    <p>As I'm a student of B.Tech CSE(UX/UI),I'm interested in User Research and Interaction Design in which User Research is all about the people you're designing for.It includes techniques like, interviews,usability testing,surveys,and field studies to uncover user's behaviour,needs,and motivations.I like this because it create a solution from a problem through which people are suffering
        ,secondly Interaction Design is all about creating engaging interfaces with well thought out behaviours.I like this because it focuses on how users interact with products and services,ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience.
